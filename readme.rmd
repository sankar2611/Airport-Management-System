This project is a Python-based application that provides a simple terminal-based interface for managing flight details at an airport. It allows users to add, list, and search for flight information. The application stores the flight data in a CSV file named Details.csv.
Features

Add Flight Details: Users can enter details such as flight number, flight name, airline name, arrival and departure destinations, timings, passenger count, and crew member count. The application generates a unique travel ID for each flight and stores the details in the CSV file.
List All Flight Details: Users can view all the flight details stored in the CSV file. The application reads the file and displays each entry on the terminal.
Search for Specific Flight: Users can search for a specific flight by entering the flight number. The application searches the CSV file for the provided flight number and displays the corresponding flight details if found.
Analysis:

The application analyzes the data stored in the CSV file to determine the maximum number of passengers who traveled with each airline.
